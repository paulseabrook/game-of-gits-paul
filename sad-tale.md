House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent. He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.


Ned Stark lives happily ever after and none of his children or wife die tragic deaths.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to
begin, and let me assure you he will **_DEFINITELY NOT DIE!_**

Joffrey is annoying and bad things happened to him.
